## HD-file-search
A PHP application that searches a MySql database containing the directory listings from one or more external hard drives. It allows the hard drive contents to be searched without having to attach the drive to the computer. Useful if, like me you have a amassed a number of external drives over the years and don't have them all connected to your computer.

### Usage
A simple search page allows for one or two at the most search terms to be entered. If any results are found, the disk volume label, file name and file extension are then displayed, 20 results per page. Hover over the file name to see the full path of the file.

### Database

[A C# application](https://github.com/DavidK1717/External-hard-drive-trawler) can be used to load the database. A database creation script can also be found here.

### Development environment

NetBeans IDE 8.1 but can also be opened in PHPStorm.

### To Do

Although fully functional, the search page design could be improved.
